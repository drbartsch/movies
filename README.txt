Project 1: Movie Trailer Website - Dennis

What is it?
-----------
This is a Movie Trailer Website where users can see some of my favorite movies
and watch the trailers. It includes server side code to store a list of movie 
titles, box art, poster images, movie trailer URLs, the years they were released,
and links to their Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB web pages. The data will then be 
expressed on the web page and allow users to review the movies and watch the trailers.


Required Libraries
-----------
This project requires Python version 2.7.x series to be installed, the latest
version of which is 2.7.11, which can be downloaded here:

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2711/

Once the download is finished, locate the file and run it. Follow the installation 
wizard. Let Python install to its default directory, C:\Python27\. Ensure that both 
pip is installed and that Python is added to your PATH. To confirm that your 
installation was successful, open IDLE, a program installed by Python that makes it 
easy to edit and run Python code.
